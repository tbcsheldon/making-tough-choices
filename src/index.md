  You and your partner have two small children — one infant and one preschooler.
  After an unexpected layoff at your place of employment, you find yourself
  scrambling to find a new job. Your partner’s monthly earnings are $2000.


  But there is some good news. You have three real job opportunities. The interviews went well, so you have good reason to be optimistic.

Youu are about to put yourself in the shoes of a typical ALICE® family. ALICE stands for Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed. ALICE families are those that have earnings above the Federal Poverty Level, but below a basic cost-of-living threshold. In other words, they are struggling to make ends meet. More than one in four Connecticut families are ALICE; combined with those in poverty, more than one in three Connecticut households is experiencing financial hardship.

For the next few minutes, you’ll experience some of the tough choices that these families have to make every single day and how United Way is doing all that we can to help them along the way.
